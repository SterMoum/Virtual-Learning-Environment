# Virtual-Learning-Environment
Virtual Learning Environment is a website in which tutors(admins) and students can interact.

The main goal of this website is about the education of the C language.

## FEATURES

Tutors(Admins) have the ability to <b>add/edit/delete</b> the followings:

- Announcements
- Assignments(any .ext is accepted)
- Documents (any .ext is accepted)
- Users

On the other hand, students cannot do any of the above because their main goal is to watch what the tutors upload  

## NOTES
### <b>1)</b> VLE was developed for the needs of the subject: <b>Internet Educational Environments</b> and we were not asked to make a register form. The login credentials are stored in <b>student3620.sql</b> and i suggest you to run it on your localhost.

### <b>2)</b> There was better focus on the PHP Back End Development than the front ent part.
